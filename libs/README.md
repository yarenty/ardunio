# RXTX for Linux
jLog communicates with serial devices through the RXTX library available from http://rxtx.qbang.org. 


RXTX consists of two parts: The Java extension library RXTXcomm.jar and the serial driver to be integrated with the operating system.
RXTX must be installed after having installed the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and before installing the jLog application.


*Please note that you must install RXTX as a user with 'root', Administrator or similar privileges (e.g. using sudo to run the installation script).*

## Installation  


| Name | Linux (32-bit) | Linux (64-bit) | Mac OSX (after 10.5) |
|:----|:----|:----|:---|
|RXTX Java serial controller	| [RXTXcomm.jar](32bit/RXTXcomm.jar)	| [RXTXcomm.jar](64bit/RXTXcomm.jar) |[RXTXcomm.jar](mac/RXTXcomm.jar)|
|RXTX native driver 	|[librxtxSerial.so](32bit/librxtxSerial.so)|[librxtxSerial.so](64bitlibrxtxSerial.so)  | [librxtxSerial.jnilib](mac/librxtxSerial.jnilib)|



### Linux (Ubuntu)
- Download 'RXTXcomm.jar' and install it in the 'lib/ext' folder of the Java VM (e.g. for Ubuntu 11.04: '/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.26/jre' and for RH9 with Sun's Java 1.6.0_04: '/usr/java/j2re1.6.0_04/lib/ext'). 
You may need to download the file to a temporary location (e.g. Desktop) and use a privileged command (or sudo from the command/terminal) to move it to the destination.
- Download 'librxtxSerial.so' and install it in the 'lib/i386' or 'lib/amd64' folder of the Java VM (e.g. for Ubuntu 11.04: '/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.26/jre' and for RH9 with Sun's Java 1.6.0_04: '/usr/java/j2re1.6.0_04/lib/i386'). Try the 'bin' folder for this file if the 'lib/i386' is not found (e.g. for IBM's Java 1.4.x). Make sure that 'librxtxSerial' has execute permissions for all. You may need to download the file to a temporary location (e.g. Desktop) and use a privileged command (or sudo from the command/terminal) to move it to the destination.
- You may need to Log in as 'root' and add your jLog user to the group owning the '/var/lock' directory and the group owning the serial port (e.g. /dev/ttyS0) to be used. This is not needed for Ubuntu 11.04.
- This would typically (e.g. for Red Hat 9 and Fedora Core) be users 'lock' and 'uucp' respectively.
- Try running jLog as root if you experience problems, i.e. to find out if the problem is caused by improper access or improper installation of the files.
- On Ubuntu: 

```$bash
sudo chown user:user /dev/ttyUSB0
sudo chown user:user /dev/ttyUSB1
```


### Mac OSX
- Download 'RXTXcomm.jar' and 'librxtxSerial.jnilib' and install them in the '/Library/Java/Extensions' folder to make them available to all users or 'Â¬/Library/Java/Extensions' to be available for the current user only. 
- Check your port name: `ls /dev/tty.*` - should be there (tip: remove usb cable and put again to see what is new)
- make it readable: 
```bash
sudo chown user /dev/tty.<yourUSB>
```
- *in java code add this port to port listings*
